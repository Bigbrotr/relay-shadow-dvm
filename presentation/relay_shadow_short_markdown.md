# 🔮 Relay Shadow DVM

**Intelligent Relay Selection for Nostr Networks**

---

## The Challenge

**Nostr's Centralization Problem:** Despite being designed as decentralized, most users connect to the same popular relays, creating single points of failure and reducing censorship resistance. Users lack intelligent tools for relay selection, making random or uninformed choices.

**Our Solution:** An intelligent Nostr DVM that provides data-driven relay recommendations using comprehensive network analysis from BigBrotr's full indexing infrastructure covering 800+ relays with real usage patterns and network topology data.

---

## Key Features

### 🛡️ Privacy-Focused
Threat-level recommendations, censorship resistance analysis, and geographic diversity optimization.

### 📊 Data-Driven
Real usage patterns from 800+ relays with publisher influence scoring and network health monitoring.

### ⚡ Intelligent Analysis
Multi-dimensional scoring across privacy, performance, reliability, diversity, activity, and social metrics.

---

## Scoring Algorithm

Each relay receives scores (0-10) across 6 dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 🔒 **Privacy** | 25% | Policy completeness + no auth requirement |
| 💚 **Reliability** | 20% | Uptime percentage tracking |
| 🌐 **Diversity** | 20% | Unique publisher count |
| ⚡ **Performance** | 15% | Round trip time optimization |
| 📈 **Activity** | 10% | Optimal events per day range |
| 👥 **Social** | 10% | Follower influence weighting |

**Final Score Formula:**
```
final_score = (privacy × 0.25) + (reliability × 0.20) + (diversity × 0.20) + 
              (performance × 0.15) + (activity × 0.10) + (social × 0.10)
```
